# What is Cross Validation?

Cross-validation is a common technique used in machine learning to assess the performance of a model. It involves dividing a dataset into multiple subsets, where one subset is used for testing the model and the remaining subsets are used for training. The process is repeated multiple times, with different subsets used for testing and training, to ensure that the model is evaluated on different parts of the data. This technique helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. By using cross-validation, machine learning practitioners can determine whether their model is able to generalize well to new data and make adjustments if necessary. Overall, cross-validation is a critical tool for evaluating and improving the accuracy of machine learning models.
