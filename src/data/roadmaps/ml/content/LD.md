# What's Laplacian Distribution?
The Laplacian distribution is a symmetric, continuous probability distribution with heavy tails that describes the likelihood of a random variable taking a particular value. It is characterized by two parameters - mean and scale parameter - and is commonly used in various fields, including signal and image processing as well as machine learning. In machine learning, the Laplacian distribution is used in regularization techniques to promote sparsity in a model's coefficients and as a prior distribution in Bayesian inference. Overall, the Laplacian distribution is a valuable tool for modeling uncertainty in a wide range of applications.
